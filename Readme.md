Car finder is a native android app that helps you to remember your parking spot.

It can:
* Remember your parking spot based on your current position or a position on the map
* Save an image, a note and set a parking meter
* Navigate you to your parking spots
* Notify you intelligently when you have to start your way back, so you don't miss your parking meter expiration.
* Automatically detect if you just parked by your car bluetooth.
* Automatically detect if you just parked by activity recognition
* Save your parking spot with Android Wear
